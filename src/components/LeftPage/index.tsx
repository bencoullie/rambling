					Tiny, shimmering white lines on dark, black flecked green surrounded by a brown grey brown of sometimes blown dust and sand. Clouds fat to thin, panting from a mouth that hasn’t closed in minutes. Leaning down, the glove on his right hand pulled up exposing a pink yellow thumb to the morning whip of an asian winter sun, he readies contact — about to smudge the whitened leaf — ice?
