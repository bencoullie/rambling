# Rambling
A different kind of text based adventure.

## What
An experiment using Medium (RSS) as a feed for a text based adventure FE. It means that I can iteratively write the story in Medium's nice editor then, using tags, am able to have it automatically published to my game whenever I hit save. It works great tbh, will definitely use this in different ways in the future.
